**Reputation and trust mechanisms**

In this section, we will introduce a matrix based on a reputation matrix to guide agents in determining whether to trust other agents or not.

**Calculation of Reputation Matrix**

In the system, there will be n agents. For an agent named 'Monkey,' its reputation matrix is considered as one of its attributes. This can be denoted as $R_{\text{Monkey}}$ or simply referred to as $R_{i}$.

$$R_{i}=[r1, r2, ..., ri=1, ..., rn]$$

## Reputation Update Rule

The reputation update from agent \(i\) to agent \(j\) can be expressed using the following formula:

$$ R(i, j)_{\text{new}} = \alpha \cdot R(i, j)_{\text{old}} + \beta \cdot \text{Feedback}(i, j) $$

where \(\alpha\) is the decay factor, used to diminish the impact of past reputations, and \(\beta\) is the learning rate, adjusting the influence of new feedback on reputation. The function Feedback(i, j) represents feedback obtained from the environment or other agents regarding the interaction between \(i\) and \(j\).

## Trust and Distrust Update Rules

Trust and distrust can be updated with the following formulas:

$$ T(i, j)_{\text{new}} = \gamma \cdot T(i, j)_{\text{old}} + \delta \cdot \text{GoodBehavior}(i, j)$$

\[ D(i, j)_{\text{new}} = \rho \cdot D(i, j)_{\text{old}} + \sigma \cdot \text{BadBehavior}(i, j) \]

Here, \(\gamma\) and \(\rho\) are decay factors, and \(\delta\) and \(\sigma\) are learning rates. GoodBehavior(i, j) and BadBehavior(i, j) represent metrics of positive and negative behaviors of agent \(i\) towards agent \(j\).

## Cooperation Decision Rule

When considering cooperation with agent \(j\), agent \(i\) can use the following rule:

\[ \text{Cooperate}(i, j) = \frac{T(i, j)}{T(i, j) + D(i, j)} \]

This value ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the likelihood of cooperation. A higher trust level results in a value closer to 1, indicating a higher likelihood of cooperation.
