**Reputation and trust mechanisms**

In this section, we will introduce a matrix based on a reputation matrix to guide agents in determining whether to trust other agents or not.

**Calculation of Reputation Matrix**

In the system, there will be n agents. For an agent named 'Monkey,' its reputation matrix is considered as one of its attributes. This can be denoted as $R_{\text{Monkey}}$ or simply referred to as $R_{m}$.

$$R_{m}=[r1, r2, ..., ri=1, ..., rn]$$

**Iterations**

We refer to a complete cycle as one iteration or round loop. For the i th iteration, it is denoted as iter i.


## Reputation Update Rule

The reputation update from agent \(i\) to agent \(j\) can be expressed using the following formula:

```math
R_m(j)_{\text{k}} = \alpha \cdot R_m(j)_{\text{k-1}} + \beta \cdot \text{Feedback}_i(j)
Feedback=Utility
```

where $\alpha$ is the decay factor, used to diminish the impact of past reputations, and $\beta$ is the learning rate, adjusting the influence of new feedback on reputation. The function Feedback(i, j) represents feedback obtained from the environment or other agents regarding the interaction between Monkey $m$ and $j$.

## Trust and Distrust Update Rules

Trust and distrust can be updated with the following formulas:
```math
T(i, j)_{\text{new}} = \gamma \cdot T(i, j)_{\text{old}} + \delta \cdot \text{GoodBehavior}(i, j)

D(i, j)_{\text{new}} = \rho \cdot D(i, j)_{\text{old}} + \sigma \cdot \text{BadBehavior}(i, j)
```
Here, \(\gamma\) and \(\rho\) are decay factors, and \(\delta\) and \(\sigma\) are learning rates. GoodBehavior(i, j) and BadBehavior(i, j) represent metrics of positive and negative behaviors of agent \(i\) towards agent \(j\).

## Cooperation Decision Rule

When considering cooperation with agent \(j\), agent \(i\) can use the following rule:
```math
\text{Cooperate}(i, j) = \frac{T(i, j)}{T(i, j) + D(i, j)}
```

This value ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the likelihood of cooperation. A higher trust level results in a value closer to 1, indicating a higher likelihood of cooperation.
