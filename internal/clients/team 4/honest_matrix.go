/* honest matrix:
update points:
	Deliberative democracy:
	voting: the non-binding vote we can see the total voting pool and the ranking of this,
	if the real vote after that came out with a  surpring result (not the same as the original)
	decrease the honest of all the agent on the bike
	pedal: get total pedaling forces(?), compare with the voting results, if no match then reduce

	Leadership:
	leadership can decide to kickout and join. the rest still can vote, but the leader make the
	decision. if the ranking and the final result not match, then tell a lie (?)
	not democrary anyway

	Dictatorship:
	the leader decide everything. if the leader choose the lootbox has different colors
	with itself, then telling a lie. if kickout a same color agent, then telling a lie.
	if kickout a same oclor then tell a lie (not a good leader)
